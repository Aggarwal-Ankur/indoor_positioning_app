# indoor_positioning_app
A hybrid solution to Indoor Positioning, which uses an Android App as the front-end and an Apache 2.3 server as the backend. The solution requires "training" the Wi-Fi data (RSSI data) collected for a building and then cross-refereneces it to the live data received. It uses various "anchors" like NFC tags, RFID tags, BLE Anchors, etc. to correct its estimate if the position.


This solution is designed as a PoC for submission towards BITS WILP programme's dissertation of MTech Sem 4
